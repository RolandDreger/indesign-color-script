# Color Script

As the name suggests, the ‘Color Script’ script helps with colour management in Adobe InDesign.

## Usage

1. Open document without adjusting the colour management guideline
2. Check settings
3. If necessary, adjust the document and the images it contains

If a new document is opened or something changes in the document, simply click on the refresh button at the bottom left. This updates the display.
